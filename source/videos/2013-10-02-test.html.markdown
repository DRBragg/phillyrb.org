Think about your phone number while growing up. You can still remember it even though it isn't your phone number anymore. Historical Details retrieves information about a domain object as it was at a given time. Historical Details was built to remember information like a phone number and then recall it by time like "while growing up".

The presentation is divided into three sections:

<ul>
<li>A high level discussion about arriving to Historical Details as a solution</li>
<li>A code-level walkthrough of the Historical Details</li>
<li>A reflective evaluation of challenges and possibilities of Historial Details</li>
</ul>
